		<h2>This Month's Author: Carl Hiaasen</h2>

		<img class="florida" src="images/florida.jpg" alt="florida" width="541" height="475">

<p>Carl Hiaasen has written a number of books for young readers that encompass the same degree of humor,
excitement, and humanity that he shares in his books for adults. The plots may make reality TV look
tame by comparison, but he almost always produces an entertaining read. 
</p>

<p> From his own <a href="http://www.carlhiaasen.com/" target="_blank">website</a> 
 we know he started his writing career as a reporter for the Miami Herald where he worked for many years.
This experience influences his writing style, the events seem to be shared with a sense of duty to observe
and share them with the reader. The fact that the events are full of absurdity, chaos, and just plain
craziness, are noted and documented. No judgy pants here. (But somehow, you know that he knows that you know how
off the wall the whole thing is.)
</p>

<p>
It takes reading just one of the books (a short list of some titels are below) to also make a reader wonder
whether or not Mr. Hiaasen was the original creator of the "Florida Man" meme that has taken on a life of its own. 
You can come to your own conclusion.... but even if you don't think he's the OG Florida Man, I bet he manages to make
you laugh.

<h2 id="robhiaasen">Hug your loved ones</h2>


<p>
We often turn to reading as a way to immerse ourselves in a story, time, or character and enjoy being
in a different world for a little while. The magic of turning words on a page into a place in your mind
is inexplicable and amazing. But sometimes, the harsh reality of reality clashes intersects our personal
world of pleasure and enjoyment. This happened to me when I heard about the tragedy of Rob Hiaasen, Carl's brother.
The <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article214042204.html" target="_blank">story</a>
was shocking, just as every other mass shooting is. But I was particularly moved by this event as I had
only recently discovered Carl Hiaasen's work and was reading one of his novels at the time.
</p>
<p>
If you do visit Carl's website, and take the time to scroll down a bit to read more, you'll come across 
some references to the loss of his brother Bob and a link to an interview he gave about it on NPR. I haven't
been able to bring myself to listen to it, but I will share the last line of his note about the news "Hug your loved ones 
like there's no tomorrow". The guy knows what he's talking about.
