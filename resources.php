		<h2>Resources for Young Adult readers</h2>


<p>There are a lot of different ways to find recommendations on Young Adult literature. Having a few different options is helpful
for gathering a variety of suggestions. Maybe you'll discover a new author, series, or an entire genre and become a fan.
And while most of us understand the enjoyment that comes from reading a favorite author for days on end, "tripping upon" a new character
or book can be incredibly exciting and joyous. I will be the first to admit, however, hunting and pecking through shelves of books 
(literally or figuratively) can be a daunting proposition. Looking for the proverbial "diamond in the rough" requires an investment
of time to do some research and/or a stroke of luck. 
For a little guidance to point you in a direction, here are some suggested resources for you to check out:

</p>


		<ul class="resources">
			<li>People you know:
   				<ul>
   					<li>Friends. This is an easy one and needs no further explanation</li>
   					<li>Parents. Yes, it's true. Parents sometimes have good suggestions.... </li>
   					<li>Teachers. See above comment</li>
   				</ul>	
   			</li>
   			<li>People you "don't know":
    			<ul>
   					<li>Librarians. If you have one in school, definitely try hitting them up. If not - a trip 
   			to the local library can provide lots of great suggestions</li>
   					<li>Review sites.
   				<ul>
   						<li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> is a site where
   				readers can share their reviews of books that they read. But more interestingly, those users
   				can categorize their reads, share lists, and thus help you find other similar titles that may be of interest</li>
   						<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target ="_blank">Amazon</a> also publishes reviews for books and sometimes
   				a reviewer will mention another author that they like to read</li>
   				</ul>
   			</li>
   			<li>Social Media accounts of authors you already like.  Depending on how active they are, sometimes they will 
   			retweet their favorite authors, or post about some of the books they enjoy(ed).</li>
   			<li> A quick search on Insta for the #yalit tag will yield millions of results. It may take some exploration
   			to find posts with recommendations on books to try, but it's a easy (and hey - if you're already there looking
   			at other posts....)  </li>
   		</ul>

   	</li> 			
</ul>

		<h2>For Parents of readers</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways a reader can find something that looks interesting to read. In addition to the resources
provided for the readers, a parent may have additional interest about a particular book and the themes that may be covered.
Or if you aren't a parent, but want to gift an avid reader in your life with something new, doing a little research can be helpful.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/" target ="_blank">Common Sense Media</a> is
the gold standard for helping parents/adults read up on what tv shows, movies, and books may be about before letting their kids
jump in with both feet. The site allows you to search based on age, genre, and topics.
</p>
<p>
Another site that will may feel familiar to parents is part of the Scholastic organization. And it's specifically their 
<a href="https://bookwizard.scholastic.com/" target="_blank">Book Wizard</a> tool. There is a path to follow if you want to Discover
New Books, and you can enter in your reader's grade level, interests, and voila!
